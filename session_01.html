<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>You will learn about the various types of variables such as built-in primitive
types, structures, and classes. Also covered are pointers and references to
variables and the semantics of passing and retrieving data from functions as
well as conversions between various types.</p>
<h2 id="declarationsdefinitions">Declarations &amp; definitions</h2>
<p>You already know that clean coding in C++ separates declarations from
definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declarations are (usually) written in <strong>header</strong> files (<code>.h</code>, <code>.hpp</code>, <code>.hxx</code>, <code>.H</code> are
  the most common extensions you'll come across)</li>
<li>Definitions are (usually) written in <strong>source</strong> files (<code>.cpp</code>, <code>.cxx.</code>, <code>.C</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Including the declarations from a header file in a source file is done using
the <code>#include</code> preprocessor directive; like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;</code> for standard library headers and headers in standard
  system locations like <code>/usr/include</code>.</li>
<li><code>#include "mystuff.h"</code> for user-defined headers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be careful that, according to this scheme, definitions should never be placed in the header files, where they can be
included multiple times within the same program or translation unit!
This could violate the <strong>One Definition Rule (ODP)</strong>, which states that only a single definition can exist for classes
and non-inline functions within your entire program, or for templates and types within a single translation unit. (learn
more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Definition_Rule">here</a>)</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>If you want to know more about source &amp; header file organization I suggest
reading through <strong>chapter 15 (Source Files and Programs)</strong> in Stroustrup's C++ book.</p>
</div>
<h3>Headers: C vs C++</h3>
<p>More often than not you'll come across legacy C header files being used in C++, such as math functions from the <code>math.h</code>
header file or standard I/O functions from <code>stdio.h</code>.
You might encounter these headers either as <code>#include
&lt;math.h&gt;</code> or <code>#include &lt;cmath&gt;</code>. Both statements include <strong>the same file</strong>, but
the latter wraps the contents of the header in the <code>std</code> namespace for
consistency with other C++ standard library features. The direct consequence of
this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you include <code>math.h</code>, you can use its functions like <code>double sin(double
  x)</code> directly.</li>
<li>If you use <code>cmath</code>, you must remember they live in the <code>std</code> namespace;
  <code>double std::sin(double x)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When using C++, you should therefore always use the header with the <code>c</code> prefix instead of the <code>.h</code> suffix.
For other legacy C headers, there often exist better C++ alternatives, such as <code>chrono</code> instead of <code>ctime</code> or the
utilities provided by <code>random</code> instead of the <code>rand</code> function from <code>cstdlib</code>.</p>
<h2 id="types">Types</h2>
<h3>Primitive data types</h3>
<p>These data types are built in right into the language and are available out-of-the-box without any prior definitions or
declarations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Boolean: <code>bool</code> (values are the literals <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>)</li>
<li>Integer: <code>int</code> (<code>unsigned</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>short</code>), <code>size_t</code> (used for sizes of
  things like arrays, guaranteed to be "large enough", the type of any <code>sizeof</code>
  expression, see <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/size_t">here</a>)</li>
<li>Floating point: <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>long double</code></li>
<li>Character: <code>char</code> (you might encounter <code>signed</code> and <code>unsigned</code> variants used
  as numbers)</li>
<li>For the sake of completeness: <code>void</code> and <code>enum</code> are also primitive types</li>
</ul>
<h3>Aggregate data types</h3>
<p>The above primitive types are often insufficient to represent your data logically. Aggregate types give you the
possibility to keep related data
items together. Examples are structures, classes, arrays, strings, etc.</p>
<h4>Structures</h4>
<p>A <code>struct</code> is an aggregate of elements of arbitrary types. It's a user-defined
type that holds the data you want it to hold; for example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>struct Restaurant {
    std::string name;
    bool served_delicious_food_today;
}; // Don't forget the semicolon!

// Defines a variable resto of the type Restaurant:
Restaurant resto;

// Members can be accessed using the 'dot' notation:
resto.name = "Atrium";
resto.served_delicious_food_today = false;
</code></pre>
<p>Historically, C++ structures could be considered "C heritage". Sometimes you'll
come across the name "POD" or "Plain Old Data" structures (see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Data_Structures">here</a>) which are
"passive" collections of data without any Object Oriented features or
associated operations. (Although strictly speaking, C++ allows you to derive
from structures and define member functions on them)</p>
<p>I advise you to use <code>struct</code> for very simple things only! The reason for this
is <strong>data hiding</strong>; read on about classes, and you'll see what that means.</p>
<h4>Classes</h4>
<p>Technically speaking, a <code>class</code> is pretty similar to a <code>struct</code> in C++. It's an
aggregate of elements of arbitrary types, with the <strong>associated operations</strong>
for the class and instances (<strong>objects</strong>) of that class. By creating a new
class, you effectively create a new user-defined type. You can think of a class
as a <strong>recipe</strong> for making cookies: it specifies <strong>how</strong> a cookie should be
made, it <strong>does not create</strong> one yet.</p>
<p>The definition of a class contains all the necessary information to create
an instance of that class:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>data members</strong> (often called <em>fields</em>): the data contained in the type</li>
<li><strong>member functions</strong> (often called <em>methods</em>): the procedures to work with
  the data (or with the class)</li>
</ul>
<p>An <strong>object</strong> is an <strong>instance</strong> of a class. Just as you can make physically
real, existing and delicious <strong>cookies</strong> following a <strong>recipe</strong>; you can make
real, memory-occupying, and data-containing objects of a class.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>Once again: <strong>classes are recipes, objects are cookies!</strong></p>
</div>
<p>A small example of defining classes follows. This is a class definition
(<code>Cookie.h</code>):</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>#ifndef COOKIE_H
#define COOKIE_H

class Cookie {
    public:
        // A standard cookie has 4 bites; no more, no less. This constructor
        // deals with the creation of a new cookie.
        Cookie();

        // Take one bite from the cookie. Only 4 bites / cookie are allowed.
        void take_a_bite();
    private:
        unsigned int m_bites; // Number of available bites left
}; // Do NOT forget the semicolon!

#endif /* COOKIE_H */
</code></pre>
<p>... and the definition of its members (<code>Cookie.cpp</code>)</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>#include "Cookie.h"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

// A standard cookie has 4 bites; no more, no less. This constructor
// deals with the creation of a new cookie.
Cookie::Cookie() : m_bites(4) {
    // Nothing else here
}

// Take one bite from the cookie. Only 4 bites / cookie are allowed.
void Cookie::take_a_bite() {
    if (m_bites &gt; 0) {
        m_bites--;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Taking a bite, " &lt;&lt; m_bites &lt;&lt; " bites left." &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "No more bites, you finished the cookie!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>... and creating &amp; using objects of classes:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>#include "Cookie.h"

...

Cookie a; // Bake a cookie
Cookie b; // Bake another one

// Eat the first one
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i) {
    a.take_a_bite();
}

// Take a bite of the other one
b.take_a_bite();
</code></pre>
<p>Note the explicit specification of the <strong>visibility</strong> of <code>Cookie</code>'s members:
The constructor and the bite-taking method are <code>public</code> while the number of
bites is a variable being kept <code>private</code>. The former means that all code
outside the <code>Cookie</code> class may call these methods. The latter means that no
code outside the <code>Cookie</code> class may access (neither read, write, nor call in the
case of member functions) the private variable.</p>
<p>The purpose of the distinction between <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> entities is to
hide as much data, functionality, and implementation details from
"outside-world" entities that don't need to see it and to provide a clear and
logical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>
for the class. This is a very important concept in writing modular code!
The convention is, therefore, also to list your public members first in the interface of your class, such that users of
your class have a clear overview of the members they are allowed to interact with.</p>
<h4>Structures vs classes</h4>
<p><strong>The only difference</strong> between classes and structs is that <strong>classes</strong> have
<code>private</code> visibility for all their members <strong>by default</strong> while <strong>structs</strong>
have <code>public</code> access. Apart from this "default-visibility" difference (which
doesn't really matter most of the time, since <strong>you're encouraged to specify the
visibility explicitly</strong> like in the above example), there are no other
differences in behavior between a struct and a class. <code>g++</code> even generates
<strong>exactly the same code</strong> for both. Check the generated assembly code if you
want to know for sure. (<code>gcc</code> allows you to look at the generated assembler
code with the <code>-S</code> flag. You can "demangle" C++ names with <code>c++filt</code> if you
like. Learn more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling">here</a> about name mangling in C++.)</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>Despite these similarities, it's highly customary to use structures for the
<strong>simplest things only</strong> and stick to classes for all other serious uses.</p>
</div>
<h3>Standard library types</h3>
<p><span class="label label-success">Important</span>
The C++ standard library provides plenty of classes for you to use. Instead of
defining your own vectors, strings, streams, linked lists, and other containers,
you are way better off using the <code>std</code> types as much as you possibly can. <strong>Don't
reinvent the wheel</strong>: always check if "that thing that you need" is available in
the standard library!</p>
<p>Just to get you started, have a look at the following features of <code>std</code> (click
on the names, they link to documentation):</p>
<ul>
<li>Strings and streams:
  <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/"><code>string</code></a>,
  <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/fstream/"><code>fstream</code></a>,
  <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/stringstream/"><code>stringstream</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/">Containers</a> (STL):
  <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/"><code>vector</code></a>,
  <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/"><code>list</code></a>,
  <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/array/array/"><code>array</code></a>,
  <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/"><code>map</code></a>,
  <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/"><code>stack</code></a>,
  <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/"><code>queue</code></a>,
  <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/deque/deque/"><code>deque</code></a>,
  <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/"><code>set</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/">Algorithms</a>: sorting,
  comparison, searching. Also
  <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>Familiarize yourself with the above features of <code>std</code> to know <strong>when</strong> and
<strong>how</strong> to use them!</p>
</div>
<h4>Choices, choices everywhere!</h4>
<p>Some of the most used containers are listed above. <strong>Which one should you use
for your problem?</strong></p>
<p>As you know, choosing the right data structure or container for the problem at
hand has a great influence on the flexibility and speed of your code. <strong>Make
sure you know the characteristics of the containers you use.</strong></p>
<p>This handy decision chart might get you on the right track in case of doubts.</p>
<p><img alt="Container decision chart" src="img/containerchoice.png" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<h4>Additional containers</h4>
<p><span class="label label-danger">C++11</span> included some interesting additions to the Standard Template Library of
containers.
You might find the following two containers useful at some point.</p>
<h5><code>std::tuple</code></h5>
<p>You are probably familiar with the <code>std::pair</code> container:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>std::pair&lt;std::string, int&gt; ingredient;
ingredient.first = "Tomatoes";
ingredient.second = 3;
</code></pre>
<p>As the name suggests, a <code>pair</code> is limited to containing two objects.</p>
<p>The addition of <strong>variadic templates</strong> to <span class="label label-danger">C++11</span> allows to extend the notion of a
pair that contains two elements of heterogenous types to a tuple that can do the same with an arbitrary number of
elements (<code>#include &lt;tuple&gt;</code> to make it work).</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>std::tuple&lt;std::string, int, bool&gt; ingredient;
ingredient = std::make_tuple("Tomatoes", 3, true);
</code></pre>
<p>Note the use of <code>std::make_tuple</code>, See <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple/make_tuple">here</a> for more
details.
The values from a tuple can be "unpacked" with (honestly, a slightly cumbersome) <code>std::get</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>std::string name_of_ingredient = std::get&lt;0&gt;(ingredient);
int amount = std::get&lt;1&gt;(ingredient);
bool optional = std::get&lt;2&gt;(ingredient);
</code></pre>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>A useful application of <code>std::tuple</code> is to return more than one value from a function.</p>
</div>
<h5><code>std::unordered_map</code></h5>
<p>Read both documentation pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map">Cppreference: map</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map">Cppreference: unordered_map</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What is the difference between the two, both semantically and in terms of time complexity?</p>
<h3>Pointers</h3>
<p>Instead of repeating what you already know about pointers in C / C++ or running
the risk of a confusing explanation, I suggest that you read the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The quite extensive &amp; general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)">Wikipedia article on
  pointers</a>,
  or at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)#C_and_C.2B.2B">the section on C and
  C++</a></li>
<li>More in-depth explanation with examples on the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/">cplusplus
  website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>An additional point worth noting is that the <span class="label label-danger">C++11</span> standard defines a <strong>null pointer
constant</strong>, <code>nullptr</code>, to explicitly denote the null pointer. I.e., instead of</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>double* foo = 0;
</code></pre>
<p>write</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>double* foo = nullptr;
</code></pre>
<p>The use of <code>nullptr</code> is highly encouraged over the use of the integer <code>0</code> or
<code>NULL</code> (legacy C) since it's more type-safe when overloading functions. Do some research and try to
create a short example to show that the wrong function can be called when <code>0</code>
is used to denote a null pointer instead of <code>nullptr</code>.</p>
<p>*When using an outdated compiler: in order to use <code>nullptr</code>, you should probably tell your compiler
you're using <span class="label label-danger">C++11</span> features by adding
the <code>-std=c++11</code> flag to the compilation flags.
Similarly, if you want to explicitly enable <span class="label label-success">C++14</span>
or <span class="label label-warning">C++17</span>, you should use the <code>-std=c++14</code> and <code>-std=c++17</code> flag respectively.
Have a look around the <a href="https://github.com/Advanced-Programming-UA/Object-Tracer"><strong>Object Tracer code</strong></a> and its
accompanying CMake files to learn how to add <code>-std=c++17</code> to your CMake files properly.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>If you want to check which type of compiler supports which feature, check
the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support">compiler support page</a> on cppreference.com.</p>
</div>
<h4>Segmentation faults</h4>
<p>Since all sorts of <strong>invalid handling of pointers</strong> is a typical cause of
crashing programs and the number one reason you'll see <strong>segmentation
faults</strong>, now is a good time to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault">read more about
it</a>.</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<p>References are conceptually pretty similar to pointers. Defining a reference to
a variable effectively creates a new name to access the variable (just like a
pointer could be seen as a different way to access an existing variable). Read
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(C%2B%2B)">this article</a> for a more
thorough explanation with examples; for a specific comparison to pointers, you should certainly read the "Relationship to
pointers" part. A slightly more technical explanation can
be found on <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reference">this website</a>
which also covers <span class="label label-danger">C++11</span> rvalue
references: We'll cover these later on in the course. Stroustrup's <strong>chapter 7.7 (References)</strong> also elaborates on the
difference of pointers and references.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>From a technical point of view, references are not that different from
pointers. Chances are high they'll even compile to the same byte code. You
can check that by looking at the disassembler output if you're feeling
adventurous!</p>
</div>
<h2 id="typeconversions">Type conversions</h2>
<p>For the conversion of simple numeric types <em>implicit</em> type conversions do the
right job most of the time. For example, given these variables:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>double a{1.0};
int b{1};
int c{2};
</code></pre>
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>cout &lt;&lt; "double / int = " &lt;&lt; a / c &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; "int / int = " &lt;&lt; b / c &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>
<p>Can you explain your findings?</p>
<p>In situations where the implicit conversions are not enough, C++ has a variety
of operators to <em>explicitly</em> convert between variable types. Both primitive and
more complex types can be converted this way. Read <strong>chapter 11.5 (Explicit Type Conversion)</strong> in
Stroustrup's C++ book as an introduction.</p>
<p>The four explicit type casting operators are: <code>static_cast</code>, <code>dynamic_cast</code>,
<code>reinterpret_cast</code>, <code>const_cast</code>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p><strong>Off topic:</strong> Did you notice the way the variables got initialized? Using braces to initialize got introduced
in <span class="label label-danger">C++11</span> and you should use it too! You can read all about initialization
on <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization">cppreference' webpage on initialization</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3><code>static_cast</code></h3>
<p>Converts between the static types of variables. For primitive types, this is
equivalent to "normal" type conversion. In the case of conversion between types
of pointers to related classes, no runtime check is done. The implications of
this will be made clear later in the course. For now, you can use <code>static_cast</code>
for regular type conversions as in:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>int a = 1;
int b = 2;
double c = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(a) / static_cast&lt;double&gt;(b);
</code></pre>
<p>(which will faithfully result in <code>c</code> being <code>0.5</code> instead of <code>0</code> when one would
omit the casts; <strong>check it!</strong>)</p>
<h3><code>dynamic_cast</code></h3>
<p>Performs a runtime-checked conversion (as opposed to the <code>static_cast</code>). The
reason for its existence will be made clear later on in the course as we
discuss polymorphism. You don't need to know more at this moment.</p>
<h3><code>reinterpret_cast</code></h3>
<p>Converts a <strong>pointer</strong> to "whatever" to a <strong>pointer</strong> to "whatever else" (no
matter the size of the "whatever"!). No other (static nor dynamic) type
checking is done whatsoever! Like so:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>// Suppose we have a good old double
double foo = 1.234;
// Let's make a pointer to that double which pretends to point to an integer
int* bar = reinterpret_cast&lt;int*&gt;(&amp;foo);
// Look at the garbage!
cout &lt;&lt; (*bar) &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p><strong>Beware, technical stuff!</strong> The above code prints <code>-927712936</code> on my
machine. Why? The hex representation of <code>1.234</code> in 64bit IEEE 754 double
precision is <code>0x3ff3be76c8b43958</code>. Interpreting this piece of data as a
signed integer (which is 32bit two's complement on my machine) only takes the
4 least significant bytes into account, <code>0xc8b43958</code>, which happens to be the
representation of <code>-927712936</code>. That's why!</p>
</div>
<p>With a <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, we're effectively looking at some part of the memory
and telling C++ to interpret the raw bits and bytes in some other way.</p>
<p>The uses of this type of cast are limited to rather a low-level system stuff and
fall in a category similar to <code>void*</code>. Use it only when you're 100% sure you
know what you're doing! (Unless you're just fooling around; it's fun!)</p>
<h3><code>const_cast</code></h3>
<p>Casts the <code>const</code> away. Having these around might be a sign of flawed design
since you can do all sorts of nasty things like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>void i_look_harmless(const int* a) {
    // but I'm really evil!
    (*const_cast&lt;int*&gt;(a))++;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Golden rule</h3>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p><strong>Avoid C-style explicit type conversions</strong> (i.e., (T) var), especially on user-defined
types. They have no notion of class hierarchies and are potentially
dangerous!</p>
</div>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>One of the more fundamental features of practically every programming language
are functions. The moment you write your first C++ program, you've defined your
first function, <code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])</code>, which is the entry point of
every C / C++ program.</p>
<p>You've already declared &amp; defined a function in the previous lab session. Let's
now focus for a moment on how to pass data to a function and how to get data
back.</p>
<h3>Argument passing</h3>
<h4>By value</h4>
<p>The semantics of passing arguments to a function is that of a variable
<strong>initialization</strong>. This is very important when you'll be passing around
objects to (member) functions. Given a function <code>f</code> declared as:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>void f(double x);
</code></pre>
<p>When you call this function and pass it a variable as an argument, as in:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>double a = 1.3;
f(a);
</code></pre>
<p>the function <code>f</code> has its own variable <code>x</code> which, at the moment of calling <code>f</code>
is <strong>initialized</strong> to have the same value as <code>a</code> from the calling context. It's
effectively equivalent to saying <code>double x = a;</code>. This variable <code>x</code> will cease
to exist once the execution path returns from the function. Whatever happens
to <code>x</code> inside the function <code>f</code> will have no effect whatsoever on the variable
<code>a</code> since it's just a local copy. This is called <strong>pass by value</strong>.</p>
<h4>By reference</h4>
<p>Another possibility is to <strong>pass by reference</strong>. Consider a function <code>g</code>
declared as:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>void g(double&amp; y);
</code></pre>
<p>You can call this function in the same way as before:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>double b = 1.4;
g(b);
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>HUGE</strong> difference though is that the semantics of initialization now
dictate that the local reference <code>y</code> is initialized to be just another name for
the variable <code>b</code>; equivalent to saying <code>double&amp; y = b;</code>. By consequence, both
<code>b</code> and <code>y</code> "share" the same place in memory. Whatever changes are made to <code>y</code>
inside the function <code>g</code>, they will alter the value of <code>b</code> too.</p>
<h4>By reference, using a pointer</h4>
<p>Yet another way of passing the same argument is, again by reference, but using
a pointer. The function is now declared as:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>void h(double* z);
</code></pre>
<p>Calling <code>h</code> requires passing the address (cfr.: address-of operator <code>&amp;</code>) to a
variable:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>double c = 1.5;
h(&amp;c);
</code></pre>
<p>Just as in the previous case, both <code>*c</code> and <code>z</code> refer to the same place in
memory because the semantics of passing the argument to <code>h</code> is equivalent to
<code>double* z = &amp;c;</code>. Again, whatever happens to <code>z</code> inside the function <code>h</code> will
have an effect on <code>c</code>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>Note that although the variable <code>c</code> is passed <strong>by reference</strong>, its address,
<code>&amp;c</code> is actually passed by value. The address <strong>IS</strong> the reference!</p>
</div>
<h4>Why bother?</h4>
<p>Why is passing arguments by reference useful in some cases? Either we want the
called function to be able to modify the passed object. This way the arguments
are being used as both the function's <strong>input and output</strong>. Or it's not
convenient to pass by value because we don't want to make copies of objects
(they are either too large, not copy-constructable, or some other reason).
Another important reason to pass objects by reference is to make use of C++'s
polymorphism, which works with pointers and references only.</p>
<p>If, in any of the above cases, you want to restrict the called function's
ability to alter the variable that's being passed by reference, you must use
<code>const</code>! Either you pass a <strong>reference to a constant variable</strong>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>void g(const double&amp; y) {
    y = 2.0; // ERROR! It's illegal to change y's value
}
</code></pre>
<p>or you pass a <strong>pointer to a constant variable</strong>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>void h(const double* z) {
    (*z) = 2.0; // ERROR! It's illegal to modify the variable z is pointing to
}
</code></pre>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p><span class="label label-success">Important</span> Use <code>const</code> <strong>as much as you can</strong> to make sure values that should
never be
changed are effectively left unaltered! Using <code>const</code> is an important feature
that makes writing programs less error-prone. Read more about <strong>const-correctness</strong> on
the <a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness#overview-const">popular C++ FAQ</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3>Value return</h3>
<p>Returning values from functions is very similar to passing arguments, just the
other way around. Variables are also returned with the semantics of
<strong>initialization</strong>. Given a function:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>double gimme_one() {
    double one = 1.0;
    return one;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Called as:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>double a = gimme_one();
</code></pre>
<p>The sequence of operations is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside <code>gimme_one()</code> a local variable <code>one</code> is created and assigned the value
  <code>1.0</code></li>
<li>On return, the value of this variable is copied, which is equivalent to saying
  <code>double a = one;</code></li>
<li>When leaving <code>gimme_one()</code>, the local variable <code>one</code> is destructed. Its copy,
  <code>a</code> lives on though</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the most common way of returning stuff from functions. On some
occasions, you'll come across returning pointers or references to values. Make
sure you know what you're doing since you could be returning a pointer or a
reference to a local variable that disappears after returning from a function.
For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>double* f() {
    double whatever = 2.0;
    return &amp;whatever;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Will get you in trouble! It might work in some cases because of how memory is
structured on the stack, but there's no guarantee whatsoever. You're basically
poking around in a piece of memory that's not supposed to be there anymore.</p>
<h3>Overloading</h3>
<p>In C++ you can define functions that have equal names and different argument
lists. If no ambiguities arise, the matching version will be chosen on compile
time based on the number and types of the provided arguments.</p>
<p>The process of choosing the right function is called <strong>overload resolution</strong>.
At first sight, it looks straightforward, at least for relatively simple cases,
but it can get pretty tricky when not used carefully (mind the implicit type
conversion for instance). If you want to know the details, read <strong>chapter 12.3 (Overloaded Functions)</strong>
in Stroustrup's C++ book.</p>
<p>Note that the return type is <strong>not</strong> taken into account during overload
resolution. For example, this works:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>void foo(int bar) {}
bool foo(string bar) {}
</code></pre>
<p>But this is not permitted:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>void foo(int bar) {}
bool foo(int bar) {}
</code></pre>
<p>Since ambiguities arise:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>In function 'bool foo(int)':
error: new declaration 'bool foo(int)'
error: ambiguates old declaration 'void foo(int)'
</code></pre>
